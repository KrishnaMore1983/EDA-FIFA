This project aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a FIFA Team Scorecard dataset. The dataset contains information about the performance of different teams in FIFA matches, including scores, statistics, and team attributes. The analysis will help uncover trends, team performance, and insights related to factors that contribute to a team's success or failure in matches.
